            """Lets play a game where there is a 20 sided die on a table. It starts with a random number facing up. You can choose to collect the amount in dollars shown by the die which counts for a turn, or you can use your turn to reroll the die try to collect a higher amount on your next turn. After collecting the money, you do not have to reroll the die if you dont want to. You have 100 turns to maximize the amount of money you can make, what strategy should you use to maximize earnings, and how much can you expect to earn with this strategy? For example, if the dice starts with the number 5 facing up, you could collect $5 100 times for a total of $500, or you could try to roll to get a higher number and use your remaining turns to collect. a key aspect of the problem is that you dont have to reroll if you dont want to and can just successively keep collecting the amount from a previous roll. Lets say it takes you 10 turns to roll the number 18, then you have 90 turns left to just repeatedly collect $18. Formalize this and solve it mathematically""",
